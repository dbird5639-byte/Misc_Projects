# Harvard Algorithmic Trading with AI: A Systematic Approach

## Overview

This project implements the RBI (Research, Backtest, Implement) system for algorithmic trading, designed for Harvard CS50 graduates and anyone interested in systematic trading approaches.

## The RBI System

### 1. Research
- Study proven trading strategies
- Understand market behaviors
- Analyze market inefficiencies
- Build solid hypotheses

### 2. Backtest
- Validate strategies against historical data
- Test with OHLCV data
- Evaluate performance metrics
- Avoid survivorship bias

### 3. Implement
- Code validated strategies
- Set up risk management
- Deploy with monitoring
- Scale gradually

4. Backtest strategies in `backtesting/`
5. Implement validated strategies in `implementation/`

## Important Notes

- AI is used for development, not price prediction
- Always follow the RBI system
- Past performance doesn't guarantee future results
- Start small and scale gradually

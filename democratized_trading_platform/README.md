# 🚀 Democratized Algorithmic Trading Platform

A revolutionary platform that makes algorithmic trading accessible to everyone, not just geniuses. Built on the RBI (Research, Backtest, Implement) framework, this platform democratizes automated trading through education, community, and simplified tools.

## 🎯 Mission

**"Algorithmic trading is not just for geniuses - it's for anyone with persistence and the right framework."**

This platform challenges the misconception that you need a PhD or innate genius to succeed in algorithmic trading. We believe that with the right tools, education, and community support, anyone can build profitable automated trading systems.

## 🌟 Key Principles

### **Democratization**
- **No PhD Required**: You don't need advanced mathematics or computer science degrees
- **Code as Equalizer**: Programming levels the playing field
- **Transparency**: Open-source everything - no secretive methods
- **Community First**: Learn together, succeed together

### **The RBI Framework**
- **Research**: Study proven strategies before coding
- **Backtest**: Validate approaches with historical data
- **Implement**: Code only after successful backtesting

### **Persistence Over Intelligence**
- Success comes from dedication, not innate genius
- Systematic learning beats raw intelligence
- Anyone can learn with the right approach
- Focus on building edges over time

    signals = pd.Series(0, index=data.index)
    signals[data['momentum'] > threshold] = 1
    signals[data['momentum'] < -threshold] = -1
    
    return signals
```
